# PyRacing - A module to get racing data with Python

# IN DEVELOPMENT!!!

## Updates

1. Since there is a huge change of the HKJC website (e.g. adding cookies, change the html content), it will take some
   times to modify the codes.

2. The project will be two stage:
    1. get data from different websites with a standardized schema
    2. transfer data to different target sources, e.g. MySQL, SQLLite
